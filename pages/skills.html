        <h2>About my skills</h2>
        <div class="text-wrap">
        <h3>Web development</h3>

            <li>I'm confident in building websites using <strong>HTML and CSS, including Bootstrap</strong> and other libraries.</li>
            <li>I'm constantly learning <strong>Javascript, JQERY and REACT</strong>, to become a un upskilled developer.</li>
            <li>Using <strong>Github and git</strong> in general is the way I managed collaboration.</li>
            <li>I'm interested in the backend as well, and I have a basic understanding of the fullstack process of building a website. I'm more then willing to learn more!</li>
            <li>I got familiar with <strong>Python, Java and C++</strong> on a basic level.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>UX design and research</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I have a general knowledge and understanding of the UX design process, including <strong>research methods (competitors, surveys, focus groups), wireframing, storyboarding, branding, planning a user journey and working prototypes of an app or website.</strong> Then, testing is always necessary.</li>
            <li>I've been using different softwares like Miro and <strong>Figma</strong>, to organise and visualise my design ideas - and share them in case of teamwork.</li>
            <li><strong>Agile, sprints</strong> and various ideation methods when designing are crucial. I enjoy being effective, open-minded and creative. The best solution is always out of the box, isn't it?!</li>
            <li>I'm comfortable to <strong>present my work</strong> to various colleagues and make them think together, adding their very different perspectives</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>"Soft skills" and psychology</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Being a psychologist, I find it interesting to understand different people's ideas, <strong>empathise</strong> with them and use my <strong>intuition</strong> to figure out what they actually mean and expect.</li>
            <li>As I was trying myself in research, I'm familiar with <strong>statistics</strong>, surveys and using data</li>
            <li>I'm a <strong>good communicator</strong> who is able to handle emotionally tough situations. I like to create harmony around me, and make everyone heard. I can express my ideas and bring them through, but I can also listen and accomodate.</li>
            <li>I have experience in <strong>leading groups</strong> and encourage <strong>teamwork</strong>, and think together, using social games and UX methods.</li>
            <li>I am a personality who always <strong>thinks globally</strong>. I'm engaged with the details, but I like to put together all aspects as a jigsaw.</li>
            <li>I'm an <strong>optimistic and reliable</strong> person, who likes challenges and is able to cope with critics. I find it very important to be self-reflective, and I deepen my self-knowledge every now and then.</li>
