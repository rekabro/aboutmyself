        <h3>Web development</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I've started learning coding in <strong>2017</strong>, as a hobby, by myself and with the help of a personal teacher.</li>
            <li>I was learning on many platforms on the internet and in <strong>bootcamps</strong> organised in Hungary. One to mention is <strong>Codeberry</strong>, which phenomenal team of developers have taught me so much!</li>
            <li>I've started to develop websites in 2020, for family members. I've realised, this is the path I want to follow. Having three little children meant a slow pace in my learning, but I was persistent, and I'm so happy to see my goal coming nearer!</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>UX design and research</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In 2022 I've completed a <strong>Creative Computing bootcamp at Bath Spa University</strong>. This course was mainly about UX design and UX/UI processes, but we also had coding lessons and many challenges and tasks to fulfill, individually or in teams.</li>
            <li>I think as much as I enjoy coding, UX is a field I could use many of my skills the best.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Psychology and Spiritual care</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>2008 <strong>MA diploma in Psycology</strong> at Karoli Gaspar Reformed Church University, Budapest</li>
            <li>2012 <strong>MA diploma in Spiritual Care</strong> at Sapientia College</li>
            <li>2012-2020 I was working in a hospital as a spiritual carer, while I gave birth to my 3 children in 2014, 2016, 2018.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Classical musician</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>2012 <strong>Classical musician degree</strong> on harp</li>
          <li>Music is my greatest hobby and the perfect way to express myself. I was playing in many groups/orchestras and played on occasions like weddings several times.</li>
