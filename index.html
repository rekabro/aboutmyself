                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p> Hi, nice to see you around! I'm an enthusiastic junior frontend webdeveloper and UX/UI designer.
                    Based on my background as a Psychologist, I aim to fully understand the stakeholders' wishes and
                    needs, and come up with creatively planned designs, based on market research and collaboration. I
                    proud myself of being a great communicator, who bridges different people in a team.
                </p>
                <p>You will be satisfied with me, if you are looking for someone reliable, hard-working, flexible and
                    always opened for new ways: lifelong learning is my motto! I definetly like and seek new challenges.
                </p>
                <p>My dreamjob would be to work together with a committed team, whole-heartedly on something that
                    matters to me - like healthcare, wellbeing, sustainability, environmental protecion, spirituality,
                    yoga, meditation, martial arts, or any kind of music. Change the world to be a better place, in all
                    senses of harmony!</p>

                            <p>Wix was  completely new platform for me to work on, but this was my customer's wish. I've found it very user-friendly, easy to use, simple and practical. I was glad to have this experience!</p>
                            <p>The collaboration with my customer went swiftly, after some research on competitors and examinging his existing website and data, we could agree on the most important issues - like branding, design elements and content.</p>
                            <p>I was lucky enough to feel appreciation, and even had time to create a few animations to make the website more interesting and interactive.</p>

                            <p>For this hungarian homepage, I can take the credit for every single step: planning the homepage, creating the branding together with the customer, writing the code from scratch, and pulling it all together!</p>
                            <p>As you might see, it is still under progress, and there is more to come to it!</p>

                            <p>This time my customer had a - rather badly built - website on Wordpress already, and she was looking for someone from a Psychologist background, to fix it, and show all her good work.</p>
                            <p>Wordpress was a much more tricky one to handle, but therefore I found, I've developed a lot through this project.</p>
                            <p>As my customer was also a hungarian Psychologist (like me), I was very impressed by all her articles, interviews and gathered knowledge. </p>
                            <p>It's always an interesting experience to try and create a website for someone who is unique, has a specific taste and views about branding - but many times, the developer has to figure it all out together with them. Our journey wasn't flawless - but I think the result is something to be proud of, nevertheless!</p>

                            <p>In collaboration with the owner of the business, the front-end and the back-end developers, and following the design guidelines of the previous UX designer, we created this new content, a table on the DermaSoul website.</p>
                            <p>It was very beneficial for me to work in a team, and enjoyed concentrating on the elements I had to provide. Always so much to learn from colleagues!</p>
                            <p>I think my own knowledge on coding was very important - it made it easier for me to communicate and understand the developers' points.</p>

                            <p>I've started to work recently on the "juhuu" website, for a young and brilliant wool
                                artist, who starts her own business just now! </p>
                                <p>She wanted to use pastel colours, one picture with the colour sheme next to it - which
                                    represents the connection to nature, but has a "wooly" effect. We were examining
                                    competitors' websites, and agreed on the elements which should appear on the landing
                                    page.</p>
                                    <p>After long discussions I came up with this simple and clear design, and planned to create
                                a few alternatives, but my employer was very satisfied with this first version :-) And
                                asked me to start building it in coding!</p>
                            <p>You can follow how this website is developing:<a

                                choose the colours and design, as this project was based on my marriage and honeymoon :)
                                - so it was very personal.</p>
                                <p>I definetly feel a calling towards deepening my knowledge in JS, JQUERY and REACT - who
                                    knows, what comes next?...</p>

                            <p>As a part of the Creative Computing bootcamp at Bath Spa University, we worked in teams
                                to create a mobile app's design, storyboard and user journey. We were planning to offer
                                a kind of pet care service, called BudaPets. Our design idea was based on the well known
                                Grand Budapest Hotel's theme. </p>
                            <p>We've learned a lot through this project about branding, collaboration and storyboarding.
                                We were working in Indesign and Miro.</p>

                            <p>In many ways, this was my most advanced work by know - although I didn't use codes in
                                this one.</p>
                            <p>As a part of the Creative Computing bootcamp at Bath Spa University, we were building a
                                design, based on a brief from an imaginary company. We were collaborating as a UX team
                                of 8 people, and I volunteered to be the coordinator. Like this, I had the opportunity
                                to try myself as a kind of leader and facilitator of a project. It was hard work, but
                                I've learned loads, and I couldn't appreciate more the lovely people I got to know
                                through this challange!</p>
                            <p>In 8 weeks we were rethinking the brief, managed to be immersed in market research
                                (including competitors' websites, a survey, focus group) agreed on branding, logo, main
                                values to follow and user personas. We've spent a long while around ideation process:
                                brainstorming, doing crazy 8's, sharing different storyboard and wireframe ideas. </p>
                            <p>After a long time on Miro boards and many descision makings on the way, we discovered
                                Figma - as the greatest advantage of this course! - and realised our ideas to create a
                                detailed, working and interactive prototype to offer! </p>

                                point in this task was, to copy a printed book's sturcture and recreate the same
                                arrangement and style on the website. I had to be consequent, accurate and of course,

                            <p>Funnily enough, I really don't mind monotonity. I've even surprised myself with this, but
                                the concentration to make it all flawless, made this working process exciting and
