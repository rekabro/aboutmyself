                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p> Hi, nice to see you around! I'm an enthusiastic junior frontend webdeveloper and UX/UI designer.
                    Based on my background as a Psychologist, I aim to fully understand the stakeholders' wishes and
                    needs, and come up with creatively planned designs, based on market research and collaboration. I
                    proud myself of being a great communicator, who bridges different people in a team.
                </p>
                <p>You will be satisfied with me, if you are looking for someone reliable, hard-working, flexible and
                    always opened for new ways: lifelong learning is my motto! I definetly like and seek new challenges.</p>
                <p>My dreamjob would be to work together with a committed team, whole-heartedly on something that
                    matters to me - like healthcare, wellbeing, sustainability, environmental protecion, spirituality,
                    yoga, meditation, martial arts, or any kind of music. Change the world to be a better place, in all
                    senses of harmony!</p>

                            <p>As a part of the Creative Computing bootcamp at Bath Spa University, we worked in teams
                                to create a mobile app's design, storyboard and user journey. We were planning to offer
                                a kind of pet care service, called BudaPets. Our design idea was based on the well known
                                Grand Budapest Hotel's theme. </p>
                            <p>We've learned a lot through this project about branding, collaboration and storyboarding.
                                We were working in Indesign and Miro.</p>

                            <p>In many ways, this was my most advanced work by know - although I didn't use codes in
                                this one.</p>
                            <p>As a part of the Creative Computing bootcamp at Bath Spa University, we were building a
                                design, based on a brief from an imaginary company. We were collaborating as a UX team
                                of 8 people, and I volunteered to be the coordinator. Like this, I had the opportunity
                                to try myself as a kind of leader and facilitator of a project. It was hard work, but
                                I've learned loads, and I couldn't appreciate more the lovely people I got to know
                                through this challange!</p>
                            <p>In 8 weeks we were rethinking the brief, managed to be immersed in market research
                                (including competitors' websites, a survey, focus group) agreed on branding, logo, main
                                values to follow and user personas. We've spent a long while around ideation process:
                                brainstorming, doing crazy 8's, sharing different storyboard and wireframe ideas. </p>
                            <p>After a long time on Miro boards and many descision makings on the way, we discovered
                                Figma - as the greatest advantage of this course! - and realised our ideas to create a
                                detailed, working and interactive prototype to offer! </p>

                            <p>As a part of my studies, I was creating this photo viewer, using JS. I've enjoyed to
                                choose the colours and design, as this project was based on my marriage and honeymoon :)
                                - so it was very personal.</p>
                            <p>I definetly feel a calling towards deepening my knowledge in JS, JQUERY and REACT - who
                                knows, what comes next?...</p>

                            <p>In 2020-21, I had the opportunity to work on this hungarian website's HTML and CSS. The
                                point in this task was, to copy a printed book's sturcture and recreate the same
                                arrangement and style on the website. I had to be consequent, accurate and of course,
                                fast! </p>
                            <p>Funnily enough, I really don't mind monotonity. I've even surprised myself with this, but
                                the concentration to make it all flawless, made this working process exciting and
                                enjoyable</p>
